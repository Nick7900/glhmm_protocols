# Statistical testing framework for brain dynamics

Welcome to the protocols for the statistical testing methods described in the paper [A comprehensive framework for statistical testing of brain dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02541). This repository provides Jupyter notebooks and resources to implement the statistical framework introduced in the paper. Built on the statistical tools included in the [GLHMM toolbox](https://github.com/vidaurre/glhmm), these protocols are designed for analysing the relationships between brain activity, behaviour, physiological signals, and other variables across different experimental designs.

## What‚Äôs Included

This repository provides Jupyter notebooks for four statistical tests:

1. **Across-subjects**: Investigates how brain activity relates to individual differences, such as traits or behaviours.
2. **Across-trials**: Compares brain responses under different experimental conditions or actions within a task.
3. **Across-sessions-within-subject**: Examines how brain activity evolves over multiple sessions for a single individual, such as during learning or long-term changes.
4. **Across-state-visits**: Explores how brain states relate to concurrent signals like pupil size or physiological measurements.

## Data Availability

The notebooks will automatically download the required datasets on first run. Alternatively, you can download the data directly from Zenodo: [https://zenodo.org/records/14756003](https://zenodo.org/records/14756003)

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nick7900/glhmm_protocols.git
   cd glhmm_protocols
   ```

2. Install the GLHMM package:
   ```bash
   pip install git+https://github.com/vidaurre/glhmm
   ```

3. Launch a notebook of your choice and follow the step-by-step instructions.

## GUI Version

In addition to the Python package and Jupyter notebooks, the GLHMM toolbox now includes a graphical user interface (GUI) for users who prefer a code-free experience. To use the GUI:

1. Create a Python 3.10:
   ```bash
   conda create --name streamlit_test python=3.10
   ```
2. Activate conda environment:
   ```bash
   conda activate streamlit_test
   ```
3. Install GLHMM and Streamlit:
   ```bash
   pip install git+https://github.com/vidaurre/glhmm
   pip install streamlit
   ```

4. Navigate to the GUI directory and run:
   ```bash
   streamlit run 1_üè†_load_data.py
   ```

## Features of this Protocol

* **Statistical Inference**: Permutation-based and Monte Carlo resampling tests without strong distributional assumptions.
* **Visualisation Tools**: Integrated plotting functions for interpreting results.
* **Step-by-Step Workflows**: Jupyter notebooks and GUI both guide you through the process.
